# UiPath-Program-Start-Up-Bot

This bot starts up programs on a computer.  I use it to setup different programs groups.  For example a programming set and a study set.

### Getting Started

After making a pull request or downloading the project, open the Main.xaml in UiPath Studio.  The robot can be run with the play button in the ribbon and the result can be seen in output panel.
